Welcome to The Empathy Deck: Insurance Agents, a browser-based card game designed to immerse players in the world of insurance agents. With every draw from the deck, players are given the chance to understand, empathize, and connect with diverse leads. Will you secure the trust of your leads, or will you lose them with a wrong choice? Dive in and let your empathy guide the way!

# Game Background

This game is a tribute to my previous work at PruExpert Labs to honour the memories, experiences and lessons I have gained. Especially the tech part of my work there has led me to this SEI course with my passion for tech reignited. I dedicate this game specifically to Leon, inspired by the dialogue tree scenarios for our L&D platform and also later on the AI based agent practice simulator in the roadmap he discussed. I have only gratitude.

## Objective:

The ultimate goal is to convert the lead before your turn counts end. You will risk losing your lead with the wrong choices.
